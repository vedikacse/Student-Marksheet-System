# 🎓 Just Completed a Student Marksheet System in C Programming!

I'm excited to share one of my recent academic projects — a Student Marksheet System developed using the C programming language. This project focuses on automating the grading process to simplify result generation for educational institutions.

# 🔍 Key Features:
✅ Automated Grading – Calculates percentage and assigns grades automatically

📝 Dynamic Remarks – Generates performance-based feedback

📊 Subject-wise Analysis – Identifies pass/fail status for each subject

💻 Clean Terminal Output – Neatly formatted results for easy viewing

🏷️ Letter Grade Assignment – Based on standard grading scale

🚦 Pass/Fail Status Evaluation – Complete academic performance overview

# 💻 Technical Highlights:
Written in C, using standard libraries (stdio.h, string.h)

Handles user input for student data collection

Performs mathematical calculations for totals, percentages, and CGPA

Uses conditional logic for remarks and grading

🚀 Planned Improvements:
Modularize code using functions and structures

Add file handling for persistent data storage

Build a menu-driven interface for better usability

Implement input validation for improved error handling

# 📚 What I Learned:
Practical application of core C programming concepts

Real-world use of automated evaluation systems

Basics of educational software development

Importance of clean code and user-friendly outputs

This project was a great learning experience and helped me strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills in a real-world context.

🔗 Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and learning more about building impactful tech solutions!
